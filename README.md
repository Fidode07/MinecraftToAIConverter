<h2>🤖 MinecraftToAIConverter 🤖</h2>
  The project is pretty simple. It's about bringing artificial intelligence into Minecraft (server). The creatures in the game are much too boring and simple, but with artificial intelligence you can give the creatures a new meaning. Therefore, I have developed a Chatbot AI, which classifies sentences and sends answers.

<h2>❓ Usage?! ❔</h2>
  Open the terminal and write "/MinecraftToAIConverter".
  .... Okay, you got me. Sorry, it's not that simple.
  
1. You **CAN** install CUDA and CUDnn. Sounds complicated, but it is (If you don't install CUDA and CUDnn, then Artificial Intelligence will run on your CPU).
2. After that, you need Java 8, which is easy to install (I think).
3. Before you can start my fine Python script (main.py), you have to install my requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt). 
4. After that go to the page [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), choose what you need and then execute the command that the page gave you
5. After that, you just drag the plugin (MinecraftToAIConverter.jar) to the plugin folder from the server and run the Python script (The AI).

WOW!!! Your villagers can now reveal their names .... 👏 
<strong>NOTE:</strong> CUDA and CUDnn are not required for this lightweight AI! It should be able to run just as well on the CPU.

<h2>Help! Where! I AM TOO STUPID!</h2>
  I'm just kidding, the installation is really a bit complicated. Just write me on Discord, I'm always happy to help you: Fido_de02#9227.

<h2><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong></h2>
  The AI was pretty stupid. Very stupid to be honest. But because I'm so cool, that's over now. I made a translator, you can now choose your language in the "Config.json". It is located in "PythonAI/Config.json".👌

<h2>💻 Can my potato (computer) even do that? Can my wonder potato run an AI? 💻</h2>
  All right, let me think about it. I have a GTX 970 with hardware errors, and the AI is still good even on CPU. In itself, everything should run cleanly, even without CUDA.

<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK INGAME!!</h2>
  You can write with the villagers with /chat (message). They will start glowing when you are close enough for them to understand you. Also, they all have one of 44 names that will stay forever.

<h2>ℹ️ Other Informations ℹ️ </h2>
  Trained on: GTX 970 (with Hardware errors) and i3 10100f
<h2>💡 Wait, what can you do anyway (useless pspsps)? 💡</h2>
  I can:</br>
  
1. Several languages (I know, I'm just cool)
2. Make your villagers reveal their names etc.
