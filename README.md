# 🤖 MinecraftToAIConverter 🤖
The project is pretty simple. It's about bringing artificial intelligence into Minecraft (server). The creatures in the game are much too boring and simple, but with artificial intelligence you can give the creatures a new meaning. Therefore, I have developed a Chatbot AI, which classifies sentences and sends answers.

# ❓ Usage?! ❔
Open the terminal and write "/MinecraftToAIConverter".
.... Okay, you got me. Sorry, it's not that simple.

First, you need to install CUDA and CUDnn. Sounds complicated, but it is. After that, you need Java 8, which is easy to install (I think). After that, just drag the plugin (MinecraftToAIConverter.jar) into the plugin folder from the server and start the Python script (The AI). WOW!!! Your villagers can now reveal their names ... 👏 

# Help! Where! I AM TOO STUPID!
I'm just kidding, the installation is also a bit complicated. Just write me on Discord, I'm always happy to help you: Fido_de02#9227.

# IMPORTANT!
My AI is stupid. Very stupid, in fact. At the moment it can only speak German, but I will add a translator, don't worry! 👌
